title:  "How to join Hyperverse"

## Overview

The HyperVerse team builds an online virtual world where users can explore, build, and create monetized assets to earn HypeVerse's native token, HVT. In addition, the HyperVerse will implement elements from DeFi, NFTs and Game-Fi, to create a virtual world with a thriving economy.

Players will act as voyagers as they explore the HyperVerse, earning HVT by participating in various activities offered throughout the virtual world. HVT is the token that allows users to join the HyperVerse economy. It also provides users with the option to govern and determine the future of the HyperVerse using the V-DAO system. The V-DAO enables complete decentralization using smart contracts. Furthermore, it allows voting on the future of the HyperVerse, preventing the passing of any unfair policies that may ruin the HyperVerse economy.
